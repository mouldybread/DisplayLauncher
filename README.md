# Display Launcher

A headless Android launcher designed for digital signage, kiosks, and remote-controlled displays. Control which apps run on your Android device via a simple web API or browser interface.

> [!CAUTION]
> This application has **NO built-in authentication or encryption**. The web server runs on port 9091 with **unrestricted access** to anyone who can reach the device on your network.
> 
> ‚ùå **DO NOT** expose this app directly to the internet  
> ‚ùå **DO NOT** port forward 9091 to the internet  
> ‚ùå **DO NOT** use on untrusted networks (public WiFi, etc.)  
> ‚ùå **DO NOT** assume any built-in security exists  

## Overview

Display Launcher runs as a minimal, invisible home screen that allows you to remotely switch between applications without user interaction. Perfect for:

- **Digital signage displays** - Switch content remotely
- **Kiosk systems** - Control which app is displayed
- **Smart home displays** - Change dashboards on demand
- **Presentation systems** - Switch between apps during demos
- **Projector control** - Manage content from any device on your network

## Features

- ‚úÖ Web-based API for programmatic app launching
- ‚úÖ Browser interface for manual control
- ‚úÖ Headless operation - Shows black screen when not needed
- ‚úÖ Persistent background service - Works even when other apps are running
- ‚úÖ Triple-tap gesture to access settings when needed
- ‚úÖ No accessibility services required

## How It Works

Display Launcher consists of three main components:

1. **MainActivity** - Minimal UI shown only when needed (triple-tap center screen)
2. **LauncherService** - Foreground service that keeps the web server running
3. **LauncherWebServer** - HTTP server on port 9091 for remote control

When apps are launched via the API, they come to the foreground automatically. The launcher itself remains invisible in the background.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher
- Android 14+ recommended for full foreground service support

### Setup

1. Install the APK on your Android device
2. Open the Display Launcher app
3. Triple-tap the center of the screen to show settings
4. Tap **"Set Default"** and select Display Launcher as your home app
5. Grant any requested permissions
6. The web server starts automatically on port 9091

### Setting as Default Launcher (ADB Method)

```bash
adb shell cmd package set-home-activity com.tpn.displaylauncher/.MainActivity
```

---

## Usage

### Web Interface

Access the web interface from any device on the same network:

```
http://[device-ip-address]:9091
```

The web interface provides:

- List of all installed user apps
- One-click launch buttons
- Search functionality
- Real-time status messages

### REST API

#### Get list of installed apps

```bash
GET http://[device-ip]:9091/api/apps
```

**Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Chrome",
    "packageName": "com.android.chrome",
    "isSystemApp": false
  }
]
```

#### Launch an app

```bash
POST http://[device-ip]:9091/api/launch
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "packageName": "com.android.chrome"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "App launched successfully"
}
```

### Examples

#### cURL

```bash
# Launch Chrome
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.100:9091/api/launch \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"packageName":"com.android.chrome"}'
```

#### Python

```python
import requests

# Launch an app
response = requests.post(
    'http://192.168.1.100:9091/api/launch',
    json={'packageName': 'com.android.chrome'}
)
print(response.json())
```

#### JavaScript

```javascript
// Launch an app
fetch('http://192.168.1.100:9091/api/launch', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ packageName: 'com.android.chrome' })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

## On-Screen UI Access

The launcher UI is hidden by default. To access it:

1. Press **HOME** button (shows black screen)
2. Tap center of screen **3 times quickly** (within 1 second)
3. Settings UI appears
4. Tap **"Hide UI"** to hide it again

> üí° The subtle hint "Tap center 3x to show settings" appears on the black screen.

---

## Configuration

### Change Web Server Port

Edit `LauncherService.kt`:

```kotlin
webServer = LauncherWebServer(9091, appLauncher) // Change 9091 to desired port
```

### Show System Apps

Edit `AppLauncher.kt`, remove this line:

```kotlin
.filter { (it.flags and ApplicationInfo.FLAG_SYSTEM) == 0 }
```

### Adjust Triple-Tap Sensitivity

Edit `MainActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
if (currentTime - lastTapTime < 500) { // Increase/decrease time in ms
    tapCount++
    if (tapCount >= 3) { // Change number of required taps
        showUI = !showUI
    }
}
```

## Caveats & Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Must Be Set as Default Launcher

The app must be set as the default home launcher for app switching to work properly. Without this, launched apps will open in the background.

### üåê Requires Network Access

Both the device and control client must be on the same network. The web server only binds to the device's local network interface.

### üîì No HTTPS Support

The web server uses plain HTTP. Do not use over untrusted networks. Suitable for local network use only.

### üì± User Apps Only (Default)

By default, only user-installed apps are shown. System apps (Settings, Calculator, etc.) are filtered out but can be included by modifying the code.

### üîî Foreground Service Notification

A persistent notification appears when the service is running. This is required by Android and cannot be hidden without root access.

### üîã Battery Optimization

On some devices, you may need to disable battery optimization for Display Launcher to ensure the service isn't killed:

```
Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Display Launcher ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Unrestricted
```

### üîê No Authentication

The web API has no authentication. Anyone on the network can control the device. Suitable for trusted networks only.

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `INTERNET` | Required for web server |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Keeps service running |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` | Android 14+ requirement |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Shows foreground service notification |
| `HOME` category intent filter | Allows app to be a launcher |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Apps don't launch when clicked

- Verify Display Launcher is set as default home launcher
- Check logcat: `adb logcat | grep AppLauncher`
- Ensure device isn't in battery saver mode

### Can't access web interface

- Verify device is on the same network
- Check device IP address in settings
- Try accessing `http://[ip]:9091` directly
- Check firewall settings on controlling device

### Service stops randomly

- Disable battery optimization for Display Launcher
- Check for aggressive task killers
- Verify foreground service notification is visible

### UI doesn't appear with triple-tap

- Tap faster (within 500ms between taps)
- Ensure tapping center of screen
- Try tapping exact center multiple times
